# AI-CatBot

A lightweight AI chatbot project. This repository contains the core chatbot code and knowledge used by the bot.

## Overview

AI-CatBot is a small chatbot project that demonstrates a simple conversational assistant powered by local code and data files. It is intended as a starting point for experimentation and extension.

## Features

- Simple command-line entry point (`main.py`).
- Local knowledge stored in `ai_knowledge.json`.
- Small and easy to extend for experiments and learning.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer

## Quick start

1. Ensure Python is installed and available on your PATH.
1. From the repository root, run the bot with:

```powershell
python main.py
```

1. Follow any prompts printed by `main.py`.

## Project structure

- `main.py` — program entry point.
- `ai_knowledge.json` — local knowledge store used by the bot.
- `README` — legacy/untouched file (kept for backward compatibility).

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or pull requests. Small, well-scoped changes (bug fixes, documentation, examples) are easiest to review.

## License

This project does not include an explicit license file. If you plan to reuse or distribute code, consider adding a `LICENSE` file describing permissions and restrictions.
